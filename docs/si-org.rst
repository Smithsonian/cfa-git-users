Smithsonian GitHub Organization
*******************************
Smithsonian Institution's `GitHub Organization <https://docs.github.com/en/organizations>`_ is
at https://github.com/Smithsonian/.

It is an enterprise account with the full features of GitHub. As an enterprise organization,
we can make unlimited private and internal repositories. Also, we can fine-tune repository access controls.

Join
====
To join the Smithsonian GitHub Organization, please:

    #. Make a GitHub account if you don't already have one.
    #. Fill out this Google Form: https://forms.gle/XsRtjRTidx8ivuBc6

We will aggregate the form responses and send them on to the SI OCIO GitHub admins to get members added to the Org.

Teams
=====
GitHub allows members of Organizations to form
`Teams <https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams>`_.
We have some Teams already in place, and you can always make your own:

    * All CfA: https://github.com/orgs/Smithsonian/teams/center-for-astrophysics
    * GMT: https://github.com/orgs/Smithsonian/teams/gmt-projects
    * ngEHT: https://github.com/orgs/Smithsonian/teams/ngeht

Teams can be nested under other Teams. People can be members of a sub-team without being members of the parent team.
Teams can be public (to members of the Org) or secret.

Collaborators
=============
External collaborators will have to be added to each repository manually, as they cannot join the Smithsonian Org.
