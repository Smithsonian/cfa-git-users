Smithsonian GitHub Organization
*******************************
Smithsonian Institution OCIO has our `GitHub Organization <https://docs.github.com/en/organizations>`_ at

    https://github.com/Smithsonian/

It is an enterprise account with the full features of GitHub. To name a few:

* Repositories: the core GitHub feature to host Git repositories
* `Issues <https://docs.github.com/en/issues>`_: bug and task tracking for repositories
* `Projects <https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects>`_: project management tools
* `Actions <https://docs.github.com/en/actions>`_: automation and continuous integration
* `Wikis <https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis>`_
* `Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_: websites hosted by GitHub

As an enterprise organization, we can make unlimited private and internal repositories. Also, we can fine-tune repository access controls.

Join
====
To join the Smithsonian GitHub Organization, please

1. Make a GitHub account if you don't already have one.
2. Fill out this Google Form: https://forms.gle/XsRtjRTidx8ivuBc6

We will aggregate the form responses and send them on to the SI OCIO GitHub admins to get members added to the Org.

Teams
=====
GitHub allows members of Organizations to form
`Teams <https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams>`_.

We have some Teams already in place, and you can always make your own:

* https://github.com/orgs/Smithsonian/teams/center-for-astrophysics
    * we'll add everyone at CfA to this team
* https://github.com/orgs/Smithsonian/teams/gmt-projects
* https://github.com/orgs/Smithsonian/teams/ngeht

Teams can be nested under other Teams. People can be members of a sub-team without being members of the parent team.
Teams can be public (to members of the Org) or secret.

Collaborators
=============
External collaborators will have to be added to each repository manually, as they cannot join the Smithsonian Org.
